1)An integer is stored in 32 bits

2)An integer is stored in 4 bytes
  
3)It would be printed :
  00000000
  00000010
  00000100
  and it gave :0,2,4;

4)if we shift a number by 1 to the left, and we want to convert it to the dicimale againe , we use :
     Binary: Dn.......D5D4D3D2D1D0
     Dicimal: Dn*POW(2,n)+D5*POW(2,5)+D4*POW(2,4)+.......D0*POW(2,0)
     
5)pow(2,7) is the maximum value that can be stored in a char

6)the first bite is reserved to store the sign
